      the payer expects the provider to get reimbursed for the service/device/drug
      from the payer and from the patient, based on the payer''s contractual obligations.'
  :paid_by_payer:
    :type: Float
    :comment: 'The amount paid by the Payer for the service/device/drug. In claims
      data, generally there is one field representing the total payment from the payer
      for the service/device/drug. However, this field could be a calculated field
      if the source data provides separate payment information for the ingredient
      cost and the dispensing fee. If the paid_ingredient_cost or paid_dispensing_fee
      fields are populated with nonzero values, the paid_by_payer field is calculated
      using the following formula: paid_ingredient_cost + paid_dispensing_fee. If
      there is more than one Payer in the source data, several cost records indicate
      that fact. The Payer reporting this reimbursement should be indicated under
      the payer_plan_id field.'
  :paid_by_patient:
    :type: Float
    :comment: 'The total amount paid by the patient as a share of the expenses. This
      field is most often used in claims data to report the contracted amount the
      patient is responsible for reimbursing the provider for said service/device/drug.
      This is a calculated field using the following formula: paid_patient_copay +
      paid_patient_coinsurance + paid_patient_deductible. If the source data has actual
      patient payments (e.g. the patient payment is not a derivative of the payer
      claim and there is verification the patient paid an amount to the provider),
      then the patient payment should have it''s own cost record with a payer_plan_id
      set to 0 to indicate the payer is actually the patient, and the actual patient
      payment should be noted under the total_paid field. The paid_by_patient field
      is only used for reporting a patient''s responsibility reported on an insurance
      claim.'
  :paid_patient_copay:
    :type: Float
    :comment: The amount paid by the patient as a fixed contribution to the expenses.
      paid_patient_copay does contribute to the paid_by_patient variable. The paid_patient_copay
      field is only used for reporting a patient's copay amount reported on an insurance
      claim.
  :paid_patient_coinsurance:
    :type: Float
    :comment: The amount paid by the patient as a joint assumption of risk. Typically,
      this is a percentage of the expenses defined by the Payer Plan after the patient's
      deductible is exceeded. paid_patient_coinsurance does contribute to the paid_by_patient
      variable. The paid_patient_coinsurance field is only used for reporting a patient's
      coinsurance amount reported on an insurance claim.
  :paid_patient_deductible:
    :type: Float
    :comment: The amount paid by the patient that is counted toward the deductible
      defined by the Payer Plan. paid_patient_deductible does contribute to the paid_by_patient
      variable. The paid_patient_deductible field is only used for reporting a patient's
      deductible amount reported on an insurance claim.
  :paid_by_primary:
    :type: Float
    :comment: The amount paid by a primary Payer through the coordination of benefits.
      paid_by_primary does contribute to the total_paid variable. The paid_by_primary
      field is only used for reporting a patient's primary insurance payment amount
      reported on the secondary payer insurance claim. If the source data has actual
      primary insurance payments (e.g. the primary insurance payment is not a derivative
      of the payer claim and there is verification another insurance company paid
      an amount to the provider), then the primary insurance payment should have it's
      own cost record with a payer_plan_id set to the applicable payer, and the actual
      primary insurance payment should be noted under the paid_by_payer field.
  :paid_ingredient_cost:
    :type: Float
    :comment: The amount paid by the Payer to a pharmacy for the drug, excluding the
      amount paid for dispensing the drug. paid_ingredient_cost contributes to the
      paid_by_payer field if this field is populated with a nonzero value.
  :paid_dispensing_fee:
    :type: Float
    :comment: The amount paid by the Payer to a pharmacy for dispensing a drug, excluding
      the amount paid for the drug ingredient. paid_dispensing_fee contributes to
      the paid_by_payer field if this field is populated with a nonzero value.

  :amount_allowed:
    :type: Float
    :comment: 'The contracted amount agreed between the payer and provider. This information
      is generally available in claims data. This is similar to the total_paid amount
      in that it shows what the payer expects the provider to be reimbursed after
      the payer and patient pay. This differs from the total_paid amount in that it
      is not a calculated field, but a field available directly in claims data. Use
      case: This will capture non-covered services. Non-covered services are indicated
      by an amount allowed and patient responsibility variables (copay, coinsurance,
      deductible) will be equal $0 in the source data. This means the patient is responsible
      for the total_charged value. The amount_allowed field is payer specific and
      the payer should be indicated by the payer_plan_id field.'
